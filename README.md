I wanted to have a way to play piano while traveling. None of the existing solutions really did it for me, so I tried to roll my own. Also includes choosable videos that are partially revealed as you play.

**Current features include:**  
Holding spacebar mimics holding a sustain pedal, ie. as long as its held, notes will continue to play even after you release them.  
Background videos which play on the piano body with two visualization modes to reveal them:  
***Matched:*** The visualizer panel which directly corresponds with the key you played goes transparent when pressed.  
***Random:*** A random number of visualizer panels go transparent when a key is played  
You can toggle the letters on and off.  
There are two toggleable control schemes:  
1) focuses on having the left hand play the lower half of the keyboard and the right hand the upper half of the keyboard,
2) lays all the keys out sequentially in two rows


**Further Development:**  
Currently, there's a bug where if you click on a key then move your mouse off it, it will continue to play.

If I were to take this further, I'd want to add the ability to upload your own videos, or at least be able to play a video based on a given url.

I'd also add multiple voices for the keyboard to give it more variety.
